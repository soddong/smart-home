# Smart Air Conditioner Control System

This project provides a modular system for controlling home air conditioners using an ESP32-based IR controller, an Android mobile application, and a server component.

## Components

- **Embedded Firmware**  
  Written in C++ for ESP32 or Arduino-compatible boards, supports IR signal decoding and environmental sensing.

- **Android App**  
  Allows users to view real-time temperature and humidity data and control the air conditioner from their mobile device.

- **Server (Planned)**  
  Facilitates secure communication between the embedded device and the app. Supports remote access, command relay, and device management.
